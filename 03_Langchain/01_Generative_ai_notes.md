## 👨‍🏫 Learning Tracks: Builder vs User

### 🛠️ Builder Side (Creating Models)

| Step          | Topics                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Transformers  | Encoder, decoder, self-attention, embeddings         |
| Architectures | BERT, GPT, T5                                        |
| Pre-Training  | Objectives, tokenization, training setup, evaluation |
| Optimization  | Quantization, distillation, inference acceleration   |
| Fine-Tuning   | Task/instruction tuning, continual pretrain, RLHF    |
| Evaluation    | Domain-specific metrics                              |
| Deployment    | Making models accessible                             |

> Requires ML, DL, MLOps background
