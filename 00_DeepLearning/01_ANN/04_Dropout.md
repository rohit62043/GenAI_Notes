# Dropout Layer in Deep Learning | Dropouts in ANN

## 1. Introduction

- **Dropout** is a regularization technique used in neural networks to prevent overfitting.
- During training, dropout randomly ignores (or "drops") a subset of neurons at each layer in the network.

## 2. Problem of Overfitting

- **Overfitting** occurs when a model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.
- This happens when the model learns too much from the training data, including noise and irrelevant details, resulting in poor performance on validation or test sets.

## 3. Solutions for Overfitting

There are several techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning:

### 3.1 Dropouts

- **Dropout** is a technique where, during each forward pass, a random set of neurons is ignored or "dropped" by setting their activation to zero.
- This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any one neuron and encourages the network to learn more robust features.

---

### 3.2 Why Dropout Works

- Dropout forces the network to become more robust by preventing any one neuron from becoming too important.
- During training, each iteration uses a different subnetwork of the full model, making it harder for the model to memorize the training data, reducing overfitting.

---

### 3.3 Random Forest Analogy

- Dropout can be thought of as analogous to the **Random Forest** algorithm in ensemble learning:
  - In random forests, different decision trees are trained on random subsets of the data and features, making the model more robust.
  - Similarly, dropout creates a random subnetwork during each iteration of training, forcing the network to learn diverse and generalized features.

## 4. How Prediction Works with Dropout

- During **training**, neurons are randomly dropped.
- However, during **inference/prediction**, dropout is turned off, and the full network is used, with the activations scaled down by the dropout rate to account for the missing neurons during training.
- This ensures that the network makes stable predictions based on the full set of learned features(w'=w\*(1-p)).
