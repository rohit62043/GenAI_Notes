# Transfer Learning: Concepts, Use in Keras, Fine Tuning vs. Feature Extraction

## Introduction

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It leverages pre-trained models to improve training efficiency and accuracy on new, often related, tasks. This is particularly useful when the available dataset is small or lacks the diversity required for effective model training.

## The Problem with Training Your Own Model

When building models from scratch, especially in domains like image recognition, speech processing, or NLP, several challenges arise:

- **Large datasets required**: Training deep neural networks often requires a huge dataset to avoid overfitting.
- **High computational resources**: Deep networks need significant computational power (GPUs/TPUs) for effective training.
- **Time-consuming**: Training a model from scratch can take hours, days, or even weeks depending on the task complexity.

These issues make transfer learning an attractive solution, where pre-trained models, built on massive datasets, can be adapted for new tasks.

## Using Pre-trained Models

A **pre-trained model** is a model that has been previously trained on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet) for a task similar to the one you're tackling. By using these pre-trained models, we benefit from the knowledge already learned, such as feature detection in images or word relationships in text.

Common pre-trained models:

- **ImageNet Models**: VGG, ResNet, Inception, MobileNet (trained for image classification)
- **NLP Models**: BERT, GPT, Transformer models (trained for language tasks)

Benefits of using pre-trained models:

- Reduces the need for extensive labeled data.
- Speeds up training as only a portion of the network may need retraining.
- Leads to better generalization since the model has already learned robust features.

## Using Transfer Learning

**Transfer learning** is the process of using a pre-trained model and adapting it to your new task. Instead of training a model from scratch, you take a pre-trained model (trained on a similar problem), adjust it, and use it for the current task.

Key concepts:

- **Knowledge transfer**: The pre-trained model has learned useful features (such as edges, shapes in images), which can be reused.
- **Partial retraining**: We don't need to retrain the entire model, just some layers to adjust it to the new task.

## Why Transfer Learning Works?

Transfer learning works because lower layers of deep networks tend to learn general features. For example:

- In an image classification task, the initial layers of a CNN learn basic patterns like edges, textures, and shapes that are applicable to many images, regardless of the dataset.
- Only the deeper layers are specialized for the specific task (e.g., recognizing dog breeds vs. cats).

When adapting a pre-trained model, you usually retain these lower layers and adjust the higher layers to your specific task.

## Ways of Doing Transfer Learning

There are two primary approaches to transfer learning: **Feature Extraction** and **Fine-Tuning**.

### 1. **Feature Extraction**

In feature extraction, you take the convolutional base of a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG, ResNet) and freeze its weights. You then add your own classifier on top of it. This approach allows you to use the knowledge learned by the pre-trained model to extract features from new data and make predictions.

- **Steps:**
  - Remove the fully connected (dense) layers from the pre-trained model.
  - Add new layers according to the target task (e.g., a few dense layers for classification).
  - Freeze the pre-trained layers to retain their learned features and prevent updates.
  - Train only the new layers using your dataset.
- **Advantages:**

  - Training is faster as the majority of the model (pre-trained layers) is not updated.
  - Works well when the new dataset is small.

- **Code Example in Keras:**

```python
  from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
  from tensorflow.keras import models, layers

  # Load the VGG16 model without the top fully connected layers
  base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(150, 150, 3))

  # Freeze the base model
  base_model.trainable = False

  # Add custom classification layers
  model = models.Sequential([
      base_model,
      layers.Flatten(),
      layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
      layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Adjust for binary classification
  ])

  # Compile and train the model
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=5)
```

## 2. Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning involves unfreezing a few layers of the pre-trained model and retraining them along with the new layers. This allows the pre-trained model to adapt more to the specific features of the new task while still leveraging the general knowledge from the previous training.

### Steps:

1. Unfreeze the top layers of the pre-trained model.
2. Retrain the model with a very low learning rate to avoid destroying the pre-trained weights.
3. Fine-tune the model on your dataset by training the newly unfrozen layers.

### Advantages:

- More flexible and can lead to better performance for the new task, especially if the dataset is large enough.
- Adjusts pre-trained model knowledge to the new domain.

### Code Example in Keras:

```python
# Unfreeze the top layers of the model
base_model.trainable = True

# Fine-tune from the last 5 layers onwards
fine_tune_at = 100
for layer in base_model.layers[:fine_tune_at]:
    layer.trainable = False

# Compile and train the model again with a low learning rate
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-5), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=5)
```
