# Introduction to Transformers in NLP

## Overview

This discussion focuses on **Transformers**, a crucial deep learning architecture for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks. Transformers have revolutionized NLP and serve as the foundation for **large language models (LLMs)** such as **BERT** and **GPT**.

---

## 1. Background & Motivation

### Previous Topics Covered

Before diving into Transformers, we have already explored:

- **RNN, LSTM, and GRU**: Traditional sequence models and their limitations.
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Used in **sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)** learning.
- **Attention Mechanism**: A technique to improve Seq2Seq models by selectively focusing on different parts of the input sequence.

### Why Transformers?

- Despite improvements with attention mechanisms, challenges remain.
- Transformers address these issues with a more **scalable and parallelizable** approach.
- Most modern **LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, BERT)** are built on Transformer architecture.
