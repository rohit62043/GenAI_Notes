### Sequence to Sequence Models and RNN Types
- RNNs process ordered input (language, time series)
- Types of RNN architectures:
  - **Many-to-One**: e.g., Sentiment analysis
  - **One-to-Many**: e.g., Image captioning
  - **Many-to-Many**:
    - *Synchronous*: Same input-output length
    - *Asynchronous*: Different lengths (e.g., translation)
- Use cases: Translation, summarization, chatbots, speech-to-text

### History of Sequence to Sequence Models
1. **Encoder-Decoder Architecture (2014)**
   - Introduced by Ilya Sutskever
   - Problem: Long sequences compress into fixed-length vector (context vector)
   - Limitation: Short-term memory issues in long inputs

2. **Attention Mechanism (2015)**
   - Introduced by Yoshua Bengio's team
   - Decoder accesses all encoder states at each time step
   - Dynamically computes context for each word
   - Improves translation for long inputs but adds computational complexity

3. **Transformer Architecture (2017)**
   - Google Brain's "Attention is All You Need"
   - Replaces RNNs with pure self-attention
   - Parallel processing, faster training, better performance
   - Components: Self-attention, normalization, FFNNs

4. **Transfer Learning in NLP (2018)**
   - ULMFiT paper by Jeremy Howard & Sebastian Ruder
   - Pre-training on language modeling
   - Fine-tuning on smaller task-specific data
   - Solved NLP data scarcity issue using unsupervised learning

5. **Rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)**
   - Examples: BERT (encoder-only), GPT (decoder-only)
   - Trained on massive corpora (e.g., Reddit, books)
   - Requires distributed systems and GPU clusters
   - Costly: Tens of millions in compute, energy, and expertise

### GPT vs ChatGPT and RLHF
- **GPT**: Base model
- **ChatGPT**: Application built on GPT
- Analogy: GPT = processor, ChatGPT = laptop
- ChatGPT built using RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):
  - Step 1: Supervised fine-tuning with conversation data
  - Step 2: Reinforcement learning using human rankings
- Safety: Filtering biased/harmful data, maintaining context
- Ongoing feedback loop: Continuous improvement via user feedback
