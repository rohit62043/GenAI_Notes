# Notes on LSTM RNN - Output Gate

## Introduction

- Discussion on the **Output Gate**, the third important module in the **LSTM RNN architecture**.
- Key focus:
  - How the output gate operates.
  - Relationship between long-term and short-term memory in LSTM.

---

## Recap of Previous Gates

1. **Forget Gate**:
   - Responsible for forgetting certain information based on context.
2. **Input Gate**:
   - Adds relevant information to the memory cell based on context.

---

## Output Gate

- **Purpose**: Controls what part of the memory cell's state is passed to the output (short-term memory).
- **Components**:
  1. **Sigmoid Function**:
     - Input: \( x*t, h*{t-1} \), and bias \( b_o \).
     - Output: \( O_t \) (helps decide which parts of the memory cell state to output).
  2. **Point-wise Operation**:
     - Performs element-wise multiplication between \( O_t \) and \( \text{tanh}(C_t) \).
     - Outputs \( h_t \) (hidden state / short-term memory).

---

## Memory Types in LSTM

1. **Long-Term Memory (\( C_t \))**:
   - Information retained for a longer context.
   - Derived from the memory cell.
2. **Short-Term Memory (\( h_t \))**:
   - Context-specific information for the current or previous timestep.
   - Passed as output and propagated to the next layer/timestep.

---

## Operations in the Output Gate

1. **Calculation of \( O_t \)**:
   \[
   O*t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h*{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
   \]

   - \( W_o \): Weight matrix for the output gate.
   - \( b_o \): Bias term.

2. **Point-wise Multiplication**:
   \[
   h_t = O_t \odot \text{tanh}(C_t)
   \]

   - \( C_t \): Current memory cell state (long-term memory).
   - \( h_t \): Hidden state (short-term memory).

3. **Propagation**:
   - \( h_t \): Passed to the next timestep.
   - \( C_t \): Updated and carried forward for long-term memory.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Gate Roles**:
  1. Forget Gate: Removes unnecessary information.
  2. Input Gate: Adds relevant information.
  3. Output Gate: Combines \( C_t \) and \( O_t \) to produce \( h_t \) (short-term memory).
- **Memory Cells**:
  - Memory cells maintain long-term and short-term contexts.
  - Proper balancing between retaining and forgetting ensures efficient training.

---

## Backpropagation

- **Weights to Update**:
  - \( W_i \): Input gate.
  - \( W_c \): Candidate memory.
  - \( W_o \): Output gate.
- **Objective**:
  - Minimize loss by updating weights using gradients from the backpropagation process.

---

## Next Steps

- Upcoming discussion: **GRU RNN** (Gated Recurrent Unit), a variant of LSTM.
- Focus: Differences between LSTM and GRU in operations and architecture.

---

## Summary

- **Output Gate**:
  - Outputs short-term memory (\( h_t \)).
  - Ensures information is appropriately distinguished between long-term (\( C_t \)) and short-term memory (\( h_t \)).
- **Memory Interaction**:
  - Long-term memory: Retained for extended context.
  - Short-term memory: Updated and propagated for immediate use.
