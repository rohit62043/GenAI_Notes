# Understanding Attention Mechanism in Neural Networks

## Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of the attention mechanism, focusing on how it enhances sequence-to-sequence models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP).

---

## 1. Introduction to Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when making predictions. It improves the performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers by dynamically adjusting the context used for decoding.

---

## 2. Sequence-to-Sequence Model with Attention

- The encoder processes the input sequence and generates hidden states.
- The decoder uses the hidden states along with attention scores to produce the output sequence.

---

## 3. Components of Attention Mechanism

### 3.1 Hidden States and Softmax

- The encoder generates hidden states: \( h_1, h_2, ..., h_n \).
- The decoder state \( s_0 \) (initial state) is combined with hidden states and passed through a softmax layer.
- This forms a **feedforward neural network (FNN)** that determines alignment scores.

### 3.2 Alignment Scores and Attention Weights

- Alignment scores \( A*{11}, A*{12}, A\_{13} \) determine how much attention each hidden state receives.
- The scores are computed using a softmax function applied to the output of the FNN.
- Attention weights define the contribution of each hidden state to the final output.

### 3.3 Context Vector Computation

- The context vector \( C_t \) is computed as:

  \[
  C*t = \sum*{i=1}^{t} A\_{t,i} \cdot h_i
  \]

- This context vector is crucial for generating output at each timestep.

## 4. Working of the Attention Mechanism

### 4.1 Computing Context for Each Time Step

1. Compute attention scores for each hidden state.
2. Multiply hidden states by their attention weights.
3. Sum the weighted hidden states to form the context vector.

### 4.2 Passing Context to Decoder

- The computed context vector \( C_t \) is combined with the decoderâ€™s hidden state \( S_t \).
- The decoder also takes in the previous output \( Y\_{t-1} \).
- The final output \( \hat{Y}\_t \) is generated using a softmax layer.

### 4.3 Recursion in the Decoder

- For each timestep \( t \), a new context vector \( C_t \) is generated.
- The previously computed state \( S*{t-1} \) and output \( Y*{t-1} \) are used.
- The process repeats until the final output sequence is generated.

---

## 5. Importance of Attention Weights

- Attention weights help determine **how much context** from each hidden state should be used.
- They allow the model to dynamically focus on relevant information at each timestep.

---

## 6. Connection to Transformer Models

- The attention mechanism is a foundation of transformer models.
- Transformers generalize this mechanism using **self-attention** instead of sequence-to-sequence attention.

---

## 7. BLEU Score and Model Performance

- The **BLEU score** measures the quality of machine-generated translations.
- A higher BLEU score indicates better translation accuracy.
- In experiments, attention-based models maintained a stable BLEU score even with longer sequences.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

- The attention mechanism improves the efficiency of sequence-to-sequence models.
- It dynamically selects relevant parts of the input using attention weights.
- It is a fundamental component of modern NLP architectures, including transformers.
