# LangChain Text Summarization - Detailed Notes

## **Overview**
This session covers three primary text summarization techniques available in LangChain: **Stuff**, **MapReduce**, and **Refine**. It explains when and how to use each method, especially considering limitations like LLM context size.

## **Summarization Techniques**

### 1. **Stuff Document Chain**
- **How it works:**
  - All documents are combined into a single prompt.
  - Sent to the LLM with instructions to summarize.
- **Use case:**
  - Small datasets or documents that fit within the LLM's context window.
- **Limitations:**
  - Not suitable for large documents (e.g., >1000 documents or large PDFs) due to token limits.

### 2. **MapReduce Summarization**
- **How it works:**
  - Split large documents into smaller chunks.
  - Summarize each chunk individually (Map step).
  - Combine all summaries into one final summary (Reduce step).
- **Variants:**
  - **Single Prompt Template:** Same summarization prompt for each chunk.
  - **Multiple Prompt Templates:** Different prompts for intermediate and final summaries.
- **Benefits:**
  - Handles large files (e.g., 100-page PDFs).
  - Avoids context size limitations.

### 3. **Refine Chain Summarization**
- **How it works:**
  - Create an initial summary from the first chunk.
  - Iteratively refine the summary with additional chunks.
- **Use case:**
  - When an evolving, context-aware summary is required.

## **Context Window Limitations**
- Example: GPT-3.5 context size is ~4096 tokens.
- Large inputs must be split into chunks before processing.

---

## **Decision Flow**
1. **If document fits in context window →** Use **Stuff**.
2. **If document is too large →** Use **MapReduce** or **Refine**.
3. **If you need iterative improvement →** Use **Refine**.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
- **Stuff**: Fast, simple, but limited by context size.
- **MapReduce**: Best for large datasets; processes in parts, then merges.
- **Refine**: Builds and improves the summary step-by-step.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Implement each technique with example PDFs.
- Compare results and performance for different document sizes.
