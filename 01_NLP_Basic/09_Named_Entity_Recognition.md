# Named Entity Recognition (NER) with NLTK

## Introduction

In this video, we explore Named Entity Recognition (NER) in natural language processing (NLP). NER helps identify and classify key information in text, such as people, locations, dates, and more.

## What is Named Entity Recognition?

NER involves tagging entities in text with their respective categories:

- **Person**: Names of people (e.g., Gustave Eiffel)
- **Location/Place**: Names of places (e.g., Eiffel Tower)
- **Date/Time**: Dates and times (e.g., 1887 to 1889)
- **Money**: Monetary values (e.g., $1 million)

## Practical Example

Let's analyze the sentence: "The Eiffel Tower was built from 1887 to 1889 by French engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company specialized in building metal frameworks and structures."
