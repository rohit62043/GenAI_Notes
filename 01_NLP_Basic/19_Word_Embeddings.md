# Introduction to Word Embeddings

In this video, we explore word embeddings, a key concept in natural language processing (NLP) for machine learning. We will discuss the definition, advantages, and different types of word embeddings, particularly focusing on Word2Vec.

## What is Word Embedding?

Word embedding is a representation of words in the form of real-valued vectors. These vectors encode the meaning of words such that similar words are close in the vector space.

- **Example:**
  - Words like "happy" and "excited" should be close to each other in the vector space because they are similar in meaning.
  - Words like "happy" and "angry" will be far apart because they are opposites.

## Types of Word Embedding Techniques

### 1. Count or Frequency-Based Methods

These methods are based on word count or frequency and include:

- **One-Hot Encoding**
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**

While these methods convert words into vectors, they have limitations such as sparsity and lack of semantic meaning.

### 2. Deep Learning Trained Models

Deep learning models for word embeddings address the limitations of count-based methods and include:

- **Word2Vec:** An efficient technique for converting words into vectors that capture semantic meaning and reduce sparsity.

  - **Types of Word2Vec Models:**
    - **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words):** Predicts a target word based on its surrounding context words.
    - **Skip-Gram:** Predicts surrounding context words based on a target word.

  Both CBOW and Skip-Gram aim to place similar words closer together in the vector space.

## Advantages of Word2Vec

- **Captures Semantic Meaning:** Words with similar meanings are closer in the vector space.
- **Reduces Sparsity:** Provides dense vectors that are more informative than sparse representations.
- **Improves Accuracy:** Enhances model performance by capturing the contextual meaning of words.

## Upcoming Topics

- **Detailed Discussion on Word2Vec:** We will delve into how Word2Vec works, including training models and understanding the architecture.
- **Pre-trained Models:** We will explore pre-trained Word2Vec models (e.g., Google's model) and how to use them in practice.

In the next video, we will dive deeper into Word2Vec, covering both CBOW and Skip-Gram techniques.
