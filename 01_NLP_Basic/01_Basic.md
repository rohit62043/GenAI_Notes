# NLP Roadmap Overview

## Introduction

Hello everyone!

I'm excited to start the NLP (Natural Language Processing) series for Machine Learning. In this video, we’ll explore the entire roadmap for preparing for NLP. NLP is an amazing domain within Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a lot of ongoing research.

Let’s dive into the roadmap to understand how to effectively prepare for NLP.

## Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Recap

Before we dive into NLP, let's recap some basics of Machine Learning:

- **Supervised Learning**: Involves solving problems like classification and regression with labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Involves solving problems without labeled data.

In supervised learning, we typically work with features (independent variables) and an output (dependent variable). The goal is to train a model that can predict the output based on the features.

## Example: Spam Classification

Let’s consider a spam classification example:

- **Features**: Email subject, email body (both are text).
- **Output**: Spam or not spam (ham).

The challenge here is that the model cannot directly understand human language. Therefore, we need to convert the text into a form the model can process, which is where NLP comes in.

## Introduction to NLP

NLP is essential for converting text data into meaningful vectors (numerical representations) that a model can understand. This is crucial for tasks like spam classification, text summarization, and more.

### NLP Roadmap

To effectively prepare for NLP, we will follow a structured roadmap:

### Step 1: Text Pre-Processing (Part 1)

- **Objective**: Clean the input text data.
- **Techniques**:
  - Tokenization: Converting paragraphs into sentences, sentences into words.
  - Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.
  - Stemming: Similar to lemmatization but more aggressive.
  - Stopwords: Removing common words that add little value.

### Step 2: Text Pre-Processing (Part 2)

- **Objective**: Convert input text into vectors.
- **Techniques**:
  - Bag of Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
  - Unigrams, Bigrams, etc.

### Step 3: Text Pre-Processing (Part 3)

- **Objective**: Use advanced techniques for text-to-vector conversion.
- **Techniques**:
  - Word2Vec
  - Average Word2Vec

These techniques are more sophisticated than those in Step 2 and help capture the context of the text better.

### Step 4: RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs

- **Objective**: Use deep learning techniques for NLP tasks.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  - Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
  - Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)

These are crucial for handling sequences of data, such as text.

### Step 5: Word Embeddings

- **Objective**: Another technique for converting text into vectors.
- **Focus Area**: Word embeddings, which can be trained specifically for your task.

### Step 6: Transformers and BERT

- **Objective**: Use the latest advanced techniques in NLP.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Transformers
  - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

These techniques significantly improve the accuracy of models but also increase their complexity.

### Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning in NLP

- **Machine Learning**: Focus on the first three steps (text pre-processing).
  - **Libraries**: NLTK, Spacy
- **Deep Learning**: Focus on the advanced steps (RNNs, Transformers, etc.).
  - **Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a high-level overview of how to prepare for NLP. We’ll start with NLP for Machine Learning and later dive into Deep Learning techniques.

In the next video, we'll discuss some amazing use cases of NLP. Stay tuned!
