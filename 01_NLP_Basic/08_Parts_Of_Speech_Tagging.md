# Parts of Speech Tagging with NLTK

## Introduction

In this video, we discuss parts of speech (POS) tagging and its importance in natural language processing (NLP), especially in tasks like lemmatization. POS tagging helps identify the role of each word in a sentence, which is crucial for understanding its root form.

## What is POS Tagging?

POS tagging involves categorizing words in a sentence into their respective parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. For example:

- "Taj Mahal" is tagged as a noun (NNP)
- "beautiful" is tagged as an adjective (JJ)
- "monument" is tagged as a noun (NN)

## POS Tags Overview

Here are some common POS tags:

- **CC**: Coordinating conjunction
- **CD**: Cardinal number
- **DT**: Determiner
- **EX**: Existential there
- **FW**: Foreign word
- **IN**: Preposition
- **JJ**: Adjective
- **NN**: Noun
- **PRP**: Personal pronoun
- **RB**: Adverb

## Practical Example

Let's analyze the sentence: "Taj Mahal is a beautiful monument" using NLTK.
