# Natural Language Processing: Stopwords

## Introduction

In this lecture, we will continue our discussion on text preprocessing techniques in natural language processing (NLP). We have already covered:

- Tokenization
- Stemming (and its types)
- Lemmatization

Today, we'll focus on **Stopwords**.

## What Are Stopwords?

Stopwords are common words that typically do not carry significant meaning in the context of text analysis. Examples include "I," "the," "and," "of," etc. These words are often removed during preprocessing because they do not contribute to the core meaning of the text for tasks like spam classification or sentiment analysis.

## Why Remove Stopwords?

In tasks such as spam detection or sentiment analysis, stopwords do not add much value. By removing them, we can reduce the size of the data and focus on the more meaningful words. This is crucial for improving the performance of our models.

## Practical Implementation Using NLTK

We will use the NLTK library to demonstrate how to handle stopwords.
