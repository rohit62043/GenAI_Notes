# Training Large Language Models (LLMs) from Scratch

Before diving into implementing generative AI applications using large language models (LLMs) or multimodal models, it's essential to understand how LLMs are specifically trained. While training a model from scratch requires substantial resources, the following provides a theoretical overview of the process.

## Steps to Train an LLM from Scratch

### 1. **Generative Pre-training**

- The first stage is **Generative Pre-training** where a base GPT model is created using a large dataset of internet data (websites, books, public forums, etc.).
- This step involves training the transformer architecture (which uses both an encoder and decoder) on the massive dataset to perform various tasks like language translation, text summarization, text completion, and sentiment analysis.
- Example: If a model is trained on a 500-page book about dogs, it can answer questions related to dogs based on that book.

### 2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**

- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** follows after generative pre-training and focuses on improving safety and accuracy.
- The model is trained on real-world conversational data (request-response pairs) generated by humans.
- These conversations form a training corpus that helps the model learn to respond appropriately to various requests.
- In this stage, **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** is used as the optimizer to refine the model.

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF)**

- The final stage is **Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF)**.
- Human feedback is used to improve the model's responses based on rankings of multiple potential answers for each request.
- A **reward model** is created where each response is scored based on its quality. This score helps to determine the most suitable response.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** is applied to continuously update the model based on human feedback and reward signals, improving the overall response quality over time.
- Example: For a chef who receives a request for a non-vegetarian meal, they may provide multiple meal suggestions, rank them based on feedback, and adjust their choices accordingly.

## Detailed Breakdown of the Stages

### Stage 1: Generative Pre-training

- **Data Required**: A vast amount of internet text data, such as articles, books, and forums.
- **Model Architecture**: Transformer (encoder-decoder architecture).
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Language translation
  - Text summarization
  - Text completion
  - Sentiment analysis

### Stage 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning

- **Data**: Real conversational data in the form of request-response pairs.
- **Goal**: Convert independent tasks into a request-response format (conversation).
- **Optimization**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
- **Outcome**: The model becomes a **SFT Chatbot**, capable of responding to various inputs but still prone to giving awkward answers for unfamiliar requests.

### Stage 3: Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF)

- **Feedback Loop**: Human evaluators rank responses based on quality.
- **Reward Model**: A binary classification system that scores responses, where high probabilities indicate more suitable responses.
- **Reinforcement**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to update the model based on feedback, ensuring that the model's performance improves over time.

## Example of Human Feedback in RLHF

Consider a scenario where a chef is asked for non-vegetarian meal suggestions. The chef might suggest multiple dishes, and people rate which dishes are most liked. The chef then adjusts their suggestions based on feedback, which helps to refine the decision-making process.

## Conclusion

Training an LLM like ChatGPT involves:

1. **Generative Pre-training** on a vast corpus of text data.
2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning** on conversational data to enhance safety and appropriateness.
3. **Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback** to improve response quality using feedback loops.

Though each stage can be practically implemented, the most resource-intensive part of training LLMs from scratch is the reinforcement learning with human feedback. With enough data and proper implementation, however, it's possible to create highly accurate conversational models like ChatGPT.
